# Alzheimers-disease-prediction-and-Classification
This project is developed in machine learning using strealit framework. it has around 16,000 MRI images in dataset with three major algorithms K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, with with highest accuracy of 96%.  This project classifies and predicts if the person has Alzheimers.
Alzheimer’s Disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects memory and thinking. 
Early detection is important to slow its progression and improve patient care. 
This project presents a machine learning-based system to predict and classify Alzheimer’s at different stages using MRI scan data. 
The system uses algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. KNN achieved the highest accuracy of 95%. 
The user-friendly web application is built using Python and Streamlit, allowing real-time predictions. 
This project shows how artificial intelligence can support healthcare by offering faster, more accurate, and accessible diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease.
